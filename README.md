## The Shoppies: Movie awards for entrepreneurs

This web application was built using React. The functionality is based on the description provided at (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AZO0BZwn1Aogj4f3PDNe1mhq8pKsXZxtrG--EIbP_-w/edit?usp=sharing). Some additional visual changes were made to offer a cleaner/clearer UI while also
sticking to a simple and effective layout. For example, replacing the bullet point with boxes for each result and nomination. Designed nominations list
to behave more as a Top 5 list rather than just an arbitrary list of nominations. Also, the search results only provides movies, as written in the doc above.
