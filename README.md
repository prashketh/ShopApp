## Challenge

### Technical Requirements

- Search results should come from OMDB's API
- Each search result should list at least its title, year of release and a button to nominate that film.
- Updates to the search terms should update the result list
- Movies in search results can be added and removed from the nomination list.
- If a search result has already been nominated, disable its nominate button.
- Display a banner when the user has 5 nominations.
